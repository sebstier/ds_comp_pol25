    "text": "Lecturer\nSebastian Stier\nProfessor @ University of Mannheim & Scientific Director Department Computational Social Science @ GESIS\n\nAbout the course\nStudents will learn about applications of data science in comparative politics. The course will be application oriented. Students will familiarize themselves with the main applications of data science methods and implement them in R. The range of applications will cover data management and preprocessing, data and results visualization, statistical data analysis, text as data methods and the validation of results. The hands-on application examples will cover questions from various research fields and different data types like country-level data or social media data. Equipped with this theoretical and methodological toolkit, students will develop their own data science research projects.\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeminar dates and topics\n\n\nDate\nTopics\nRequired reading\n\n\n\n\n8 April 2025\n\nIntroduction and expectations\nSetup in R\n\n\n\n\n15 April 2025\n\nFoundations of data science\nFoundations of comparative politics\nThe tidyverse in R\n\nCaramani, D.
